Sass, like all preprocessors is great for taking out the vendor prefixes from your code. 
This mixin sets box-sizing and handle the prefixes once:

@mixin box-sizing($type)
 {
 -webkit-box-sizing:$type;
 -moz-box-sizing:$type;
 box-sizing:$type;
 }

Usage:

div {
 @include box-sizing(border-box);
 }
